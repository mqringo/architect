// Software architecture Good Practices

-Loose coupling—components do not hold strong dependencies on other components.
-High cohesion—components have clearly bounded responsibilities, and their internal elements are strongly related.
-Clear and appropriate version compatibility.
-Clear and appropriate cross-team testing.
-At a conceptual level, software architectures should resemble the flows of change they enable; instead of a series of interconnected components, we should be designing flows on top of an underlying platform.
